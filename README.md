# Algorithm List (DSA Practice)

#### [1. ArrayList (Linear Time Algorithm)](./arraylist.py)

#### [2. Binary Search (logarithmic time complexity)](./binerySearch.py)

#### [3. Recursive Binary Search (logarithmic time complexity but space complexity will depends on Language programming language if it support tail call elimination)](./recursive.py)

#### [4. LinkedList (<Br/> &emsp;1. adding data to the head takes o(1) constant time but find specific data or key takes linear Time O(n) <Br />&emsp; 2. Insert takes o(1) time but finding a node at insertion position takes o(n) time Overall it takes o(n) time <Br />&emsp; 3. Remove takes o(1) time but finding a node takes o(n) time so overall it takes o(n) time<Br />&emsp;) ](./linked_list.py)
