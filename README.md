# Algorithm List (DSA Practice)

#### 1. ArrayList (Linear Time Algorithm)

#### 2. Binary Search (logarithmic time complexity)

#### 3. Recursive Binary Search (logarithmic time complexity but space complexity will depends on Language programming language if it support tail call elimination)

#### 4. LinkedList (1. adding data to the head takes o(1) constant time but find specific data or key takes linear Time O(n) 2.Insert takes o(1) time but finding a node at insertion position takes o(n) time Overall it takes o(n) time a )
