# Algorithm List (DSA Practice)

#### 1. ArrayList (Linear Time Algorithm)
#### 2. Binary Search (logarithmic time complexity)
#### 3. Recursive Binary Search (logarithmic time complexity but space complexity will depends on Language programming language if it support tail call elimination)
#### 4. LinkedList (adding data to the head takes constant time but find specific data or key takes linear Time)
